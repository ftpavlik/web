Hi there! Hopefully you’ve already had a chance to enjoy our first free, fully illustrated issue of <cite>Midnight Breakfast</cite>. We’ve funded this issue ourselves in preparation for the launch of our fundraising campaign to help us keep the magazine running the way we originally envisioned. We want to continue to publish exciting work from a diverse group of writers and artists, and we want to pay all of our contributors. To do this, we’re going to need a lot of help.

If you want to find out when the campaign begins and get any other <cite>Midnight Breakfast</cite> news, sign up for our mailing list below. We hate any spam that doesn’t come in a can, so rest assured that you’ll only get <cite>Midnight Breakfast</cite>-related emails. Thanks for your interest!
