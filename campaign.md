Hi there! Hopefully you’ve already had a chance to enjoy our free, fully illustrated issue of Midnight Breakfast. We’ve funded this issue ourselves in conjunction with the launch of our fundraising campaign to publish Midnight Breakfast for a full year. We want to publish a free journal that provides a voice for writers and artists from all walks of life and we want to pay all of them, so we’re going to need a lot of help. If you want to find out when the campaign begins and get any other Midnight Breakfast news, sign up for our mailing list below. We hate any spam that doesn’t come in a can, so rest assured that you’ll only get Midnight Breakfast-related emails. Thanks for your interest!
